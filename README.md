# CloudBees Core AWS Quick Start
Survey after survey shows JenkinsÂ® is the most popular open source automation server - and for good reason. However, Jenkins alone often lacks what teams need as continuous delivery scales across an organization. CloudBees Core extends Jenkins with functionality that embeds best practices, supports rapid on-boarding, provides tools for easier admin management and is based on an architecture that was built for scalability. You get enterprise-level benefits along with the Jenkins automation you already love.
